Tell Joey if we make the website: https://github.com/joereynolds/what-to-code#websites

Use cases:

- On homepage, make a calendar, share with 1 click. No logins. Can use random/default ID or pick your own.
- Visiting pastecal.com/ID creates the calendar (prefilled option to create)
- Visiting homepage, make changes, stored in localstorage. Refresh page, changes still there.

TODO:

- 5am mode

FUTURE:

- Event color (based on hashtag?)
- Remember recents in localstorage
- Help/tour button
- Readonly flag
- Password protection

DONE:

- Figure out creation and permissions issue
- Rename Calendar Title
- Visiting URL directly (/doesnotexist) should have button to create
- Have mode for full 24 hours
- Make it responsive (with all-hours moved via JS to just below the nav)
- Have it save the calendar to localstorage until you share it
