https://pastecal.com - zero-login shared calendar.

(Inspiration: https://github.com/joereynolds/what-to-code#websites and https://www.viaprize.org/campaign/37/an-online-calendar-that-doesn-t-require-login-or-auth)

Use cases:

- On homepage, make a calendar, share with 1 click. No logins. Can use random/default ID or pick your own.
- Visiting pastecal.com/ID creates the calendar (prefilled option to create)
- Visiting homepage, make changes, stored in localstorage. Refresh page, changes still there.
