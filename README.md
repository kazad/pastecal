https://pastecal.com - zero-login shared calendar.

(Inspiration: https://github.com/joereynolds/what-to-code#websites and https://www.viaprize.org/campaign/37/an-online-calendar-that-doesn-t-require-login-or-auth)

Use cases:

- On homepage, make a calendar, share with 1 click. No logins. Can use random/default ID or pick your own.
- Visiting pastecal.com/ID creates the calendar (prefilled option to create)

- Visit homepage, make changes. They're stored in localstorage, no need to publish your personal calendar.
- Visit `pastecal.com/?d={YYYYMMDD|YYMMDD|YY-MM-DD...}&v={day,week,month,year}` to jump a calendar to that date and/or view. Example: [pastecal.com/?d=2022-04-01&v=month](https://pastecal.com/?d=2022-04-01&v=month)
