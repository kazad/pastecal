https://pastecal.com - zero-login shared calendar.

(Inspiration: https://github.com/joereynolds/what-to-code#websites and https://www.viaprize.org/prize/old/1)

Use cases:

- From homepage, make a shared calendar with 1 click. No logins. Use the default (random) ID or pick your own.

- Visiting pastecal.com/customID makes a calendar (pre-filled option to create)

- Visit homepage, make changes without sharing. Your private calendar is stored in localStorage, no need to publish.

- Open a calendar to specific date/view with `pastecal.com/?d={YYYYMMDD|YYMMDD|YY-MM-DD...}&v={day,week,month,year}`. Example: [pastecal.com/?d=2022-04-01&v=month](https://pastecal.com/?d=2022-04-01&v=month)
